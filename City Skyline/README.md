# City Skyline

This code creates a city skyline with background and foreground buildings using HTML and CSS. 

Features:

* Responsive Design: The buildings and sky adapt to different screen sizes. On smaller screens (<1000px), the colors turn monochrome for a night-like effect.
* Layered 3D Effect: The skyline has background and foreground buildings, creating a sense of depth. Foreground buildings appear closer, while background buildings appear farther away.
* Dynamic Building Styles: Various building shapes using divs and border techniques. Buildings have different heights, widths, and colors to resemble a real skyline. Windows are added using gradient effects and small div elements.
* Beautiful Sunset Sky: The background features a radial gradient for a sunset or dawn effect. Colors transition smoothly from yellow (#ffcf33) to blue (#bbeeff).
* Easy to Customize: Uses CSS variables (--building-color1, --window-color1, etc.), making it simple to change colors. Additional buildings or design elements can be easily added by modifying divs and styles.
